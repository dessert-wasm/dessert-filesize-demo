# Dessert Demo

This toy project allows you to parse YAML into JSON. It is part of the
[Dessert](#) project. We use it in order to demonstrate how easy it is
to replace a JavaScript block of your application to a WASM one and improve
performance at less cost. Please, take a look at [this page](#) if you want to
know more.


## Run locally

This demo is a standard React application. So:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## WASM integration

This project is configured to work with WASM components. Take a look
at [this page](#) if you want to learn to do so.
